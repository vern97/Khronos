*Do you have any specific design ideas such as colors or layout? Should we use any team colors?*   

No, because our site is aimed at all swimming teams, we don't need to include colors of any one team. We like sleek color palettes, maybe black, white, and perhaps blues that make the user thinking of crystal clear waters.    

*When you say the general public will be able to search information, should the user enter a specific search query or can a user view all athletes in the system, for example, then view results for that athlete?*     

For individual athlete results, the user should enter a specific name to view athlete information. We don't want users to see all athletes in the system because the list would be lengthy and inefficient.       

*Should the athlete data be public or private for coaches only as mentioned in The 3 Product Core Features #2? Is it exclusive to the coaches and their athletes or is it meant to be seen by anyone*?

The information that we would like our site to display for each athlete will only be visible to visitors on our site if they have an account. Until we implement paid features, there are no restrictions to who can make an account or the information users can view.

*Referring to List of Needs and Features #4; do employees and Contractors take up the title of an Admin? or are admins separate entities from Employees and Contractors*?

At this time, we can define employees and contractors as admins. When we roll out the ability to have athletes separated into teams, we would like to have it so that coaches and contractors can only add, edit or delete any information that belongs to the athletes on their team only.

*You request that all athlete information is made public; are visitors required to make an account and sign in to view information on athletes, or can a visitor be an ‘anonymous’ guest of the website and still view athlete information*?

As we talked about earlier, the information is public to any user at this time, however, they must have made an account on our website to view the information. Because anyone can make an account for free, we consider this public information.

*Athletes that are entered into your system, are they meant to be tagged as an “athlete” and given access to paid features once you make the transition to paid plans, or will they be given a “standard” account and be required to purchase access to “non-standard” features*?

Currently we have no plans to differentiate "standard" users from "athlete" users. Our current plans reflect so as that all user must purchase our paid features when we decide to roll them out, with he exception of administrator users.

*If athlete accounts are to be tagged as "athlete", what type of verification can an athlete provide to prove they are in fact an athlete*?

Currently we have no plans to implement "athlete" accounts.

*In the future, will you expect to track and record more than just swimming athletes? If so, we can plan on creating code that is easily scalable to other event and athlete types*.

At this time, our vision only reflects tracking events that are associated with swimming and swimming only. We are not worried about future scaleability at this time.    

*You mentioned wanting to display information such as a plot of performance per race type and distance, measure of how athletes rank, and more. Do you want to have all of this displayed on the page at once or should users be presented with a menu of options?*   
We think displayed all the information at once could make the site look cluttered and difficult to navigate. We would prefer that users only see exactly the results they want.
